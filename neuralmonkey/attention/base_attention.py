"""Decoding functions using multiple attentions for RNN decoders.

See http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07481

The attention mechanisms used in Neural Monkey are inherited from the
``BaseAttention`` class defined in this module.

The attention function can be viewed as a soft lookup over an associative
memory. The *query* vector is used to compute a similarity score of the *keys*
of the associative memory and the resulting scores are used as weights in a
weighted sum of the *values* associated with the keys. We call the
(unnormalized) similarity scores *energies*, we call *attention distribution*
the energies after (softmax) normalization, and we call the resulting
weighted sum of states a *context vector*.

Note that it is possible (and true in most cases) that the attention keys
are equal to the values. In case of self-attention, even queries are from the
same set of vectors.

To abstract over different flavors of attention mechanism, we conceptualize the
procedure as follows: Each attention object has the ``attention`` function
which operates on the query tensor. The attention function receives the query
tensor (the decoder state) and optionally the previous state of the decoder,
and computes the context vector. The function also receives a *loop state*,
which is used to store data in an autoregressive loop that generates a
sequence.

The attention uses the loop state to store to store attention distributions
and context vectors in time. This structure is called ``AttentionLoopState``.
To be able to initialize the loop state, each attention object that uses this
feature defines the ``initial_loop_state`` function with empty tensors.

Since there can be many *modes* in which the decoder that uses the attention
operates, the attention objects have the ``finalize_loop`` method, which takes
the last attention loop state and the name of the mode (a string) and processes
this data to be available in the ``histories`` dictionary. The single and most
used example of two *modes* are the *train* and *runtime* modes of the
autoregressive decoder.
